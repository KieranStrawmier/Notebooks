The New York Mets had a legitimate chance to make the 2019 playoffs. They had 10 players with higher than a 100 OPS+, the NL CY Young Award winner in Jacob deGrom and all six starters had an ERA+ of slightly below or above 100. So why did they not make the playoffs?

The meltdown game. 

On a late night in early September, the Mets showed why when they gave up a six-run lead with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning to the eventual World Series Championship, The Washington Nationals. 

After this nightmare of an inning, they gradually fell further and further from the last playoff spot. By the end of the season, the Mets were four games behind the Brewers, the last Wild Card team. 

The Problem for the Mets was their bullpen.

The best reliever in the National League was Josh Hader. The three pitchers in the 9th inning were in a different area code. While they were all had around average ERAs or WHIPs, logic says you put your best guy in the game when you need the win. 

But with a six-run lead in the bottom of the ninth, you can usually get away with a non-traditional closer to save your best arms, except when you are in the playoff race and need every win to survive. 

So the Mets pitching staff in 2019 was good but didn't have a lot of depth after they pulled their starters.

This game was a historic choke by the Mets. But the Nationals players that batted in this inning were some of the best in the league in 2019.

So, the eight players that walked up to the plate this inning were pretty scary. 

Three of them are near the best all-time baseball player, Mike Trout. 

Seeing these two charts, most people wouldn't be surprised about the Mets blowing a massive lead with two outs till the end of the game.

Regardless, The Met's win expectancy was at or above 50% for 70% of the game.

So how did they go from 100% win expectancy to 0% in just eight plays?

First, let's look at the Met's top of the ninth inning for more context to this catastrophic collapse.

The Mets started the inning with a 5-4 lead.

Brandon Nimmo took the first pitch and sent it over the wall. The Mets scored four more runs and presumably took to soul out of the Nationals going into the bottom of the ninth.

Ok, now back to the inning in question.

Paul Sewald came in to pitch the ninth, a slightly below-average pitcher regarding ERA and a respectable 1.068 WHIP, (Note he pitched only 19 full innings that year). 

Here's how it went:
Single,
Flyball; Out,
Double,
Single,
Single.

The Score is now 5-10. 

The Nationals have a 5% win expectancy.

Luis Avilan replaced Sewald. Avilan was an average as a pitcher in 2019 (where the two black lines meet on the pitching scatterplot would be the league average for ERA and WHIP). 

Juan Soto snuck a single through the infield loading the bases. They then Pulled Avilan after throwing four pitches. 

The Score is now 6-10. 

The Nationals have an 11% win expectancy.

The Mets then put their last pitcher in for the inning, Edwin Diaz. Diaz had elite numbers when it came to everything except, HardHit%, Barrel% and average exit velocity.

So when contact was made, which was rare with a whiff% in the 98% percentile, it was hit hard and far.

Double,
Home Run.

The Nationals hero, Kurt Suzuki, had a 3-2 count in an eight-pitch at-bat when he took a 100 mph fastball to deep left field for a walk-off home run into a sparsely populated crowd of Nationals faithful, sending Edwin and the Mets home with their hope shattered.
